### Mini Project ( Bank System ) 
Build an application that constitutes for a banking platform, it should handle the account transacs,
  	for credit and debit as per the banking systems , we should 
  	have the account details tracked as well.
  	Topics to be used: Java = ( Streams , Lambdas / Oops / List Collection)
 		
     1.  Menu Driven Approach
     2.  Check if old user / new user 
     3.  If new user - validation of Pin of the bank account
     4.  Opening message - with the options for the actions that can be performed by the user according to the option opted for E.g Credit/Debit do accordingly 
     5.  if debit needs to be performed , have to check if the amount debitted is present in the account 
       - The account in which the amount will be transferred is a valid account 
       - Transaction/authentication password confirmation 
       - once the transaction takes place , both the parties query is resolved then only commit or else 
        rollback takes place in case of error.
       - a confirmation message with the menu being shown again for any other action to be done .
